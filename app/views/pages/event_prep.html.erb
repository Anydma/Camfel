            </div>
                <p>Our full three-screen set-up requires a 45” width, 12” height, and 23’ projection distance from
                    screens to projectors.<br/><br/>
                    For smaller locations, we can reduce the size of the screens—requiring 30’ width, 8’ height. <br/><br/>
                    Our programs can be shown in any type of room including: gymnasiums, auditoriums, multipurpose
                    rooms. & cafeterias.</p>

            </div>
            <p>As with any projected image, the darker the room, the greater the effect. Any windows or skylights
                should be covered prior to our arrival.<br/><br/>
               However, our projectors are fairly bright and can handle it some ambient light in the room.
                Just know that a darker room will give you a better looking image. <br/><br/>
