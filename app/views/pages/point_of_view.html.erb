        <br/>
        
          <p class = "gibberish">The RIGHT CHOICE will help your elementary students discern which decisions are the best
            decisions. The program will address how the choices they make will affect hem in both positive
            and negative ways. Positive choices like being active, eating the right food, listening to their
            teacher, doing their homework, and being a good friend, will help them feel healthy, get along
            with others, and enable them to do well in school. Negative choices, like eating junk food, acting
            up in class, and being a bully, will only bring trouble.
            The RIGHT CHOICE provides students with the skills needed to handle bullying, make good
            choices, and encourage them to help those around them. They will learn that good decisions lead
            to positive actions, and that the right choices will help them and their friends excel in school and
            in life.
