        <h2> Theme: Being Your Best</h2>
        <br/>
        
          <p >Heroes are amazing! They wear cool costumes and fly around being brave and saving people from the villains of the world. 
          Everyone looks up to them! They're...well...they're HEROES!<br/> <br/>
 
            Camfel's BE A HERO! interactive assembly program will motivate your students to be heroes too! 
            Sure, that won't mean cool costumes and flight will be options for them, 
            but it will mean that they can behave like a hero by standing up for others and working hard to be their best.<br/><br/>
 
            Heroes don't let bullies hold them back from being positive and working hard to achieve their goals. 
            They may not be able to leap over tall buildings, or bend steel, but they can be a "hero" to someone in need of a friend or help someone who is being bullied.<br/><br/>
 
            BE A HERO! is an interactive program that will encourage your students to excel in school, 
            to help stop bullying, and to be a role-model - a "hero" for others to follow.
