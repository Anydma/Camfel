        <h2> Theme: Respect</h2>
        <br/>
        
          <p >We respect those who follow the Golden Rule. We respect those who are willing to face challenges to help others. 
          We respect those who are willing to make a difference. 
          Being respected involves hard work and a willingness to put others first. 
          Instead of putting out the effort, we often choose being "popular" over being respected.<br/><br/>
 
            The Golden Rule will talk about our willingness to be rude or mean to others, 
            or to misbehave in class simply to gain attention for ourselves 
            - we want respect and we'll do anything to get it!<br/><br/>
 
            The Golden Rule will demonstrate that true respect is earned over time. 
            When we do our best in class and when we build up others instead of being mean, we will gain "true" respect.
